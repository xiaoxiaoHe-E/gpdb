  <title>Working with View Dependencies</title>
  <body>
    <p>If there are view dependencies on a table you must use the <codeph>CASCADE</codeph> keyword
      to drop it. Also, you cannot alter the table if there are view dependencies on it. This
      example shows a view dependency on a
      table.<codeblock>CREATE TABLE t (id integer PRIMARY KEY);
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t;
 
DROP TABLE t;
ERROR:  cannot drop table t because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  view v depends on table t
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
 
ALTER TABLE t DROP id;
ERROR:  cannot drop column id of table t because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  view v depends on column id of table t
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.</codeblock></p>
    <p>As the previous example shows, altering a table can be quite a challenge if there is a deep
      hierarchy of views, because you have to create the views in the correct order. You cannot
      create a view unless all the objects it requires are present.</p>
    <p>You can use view dependency information when you want to alter a table that is referenced by
      a view. For example, you might want to change a table's column data type from
        <codeph>integer</codeph> to <codeph>bigint</codeph> because you realize you need to store
      larger numbers. However, you cannot do that if there are views that use the column. You first
      have to drop those views, then change the column and then run all the <codeph>CREATE
        VIEW</codeph> statements to create the views again.</p>

      <p>The following example queries list view information on dependencies on tables and columns. </p>

      <p>The example output is based on the <xref href="#topic_find_v_examples/example_data"
          format="dita"/> at the end of this topic. </p>
      <p>Also, you can use the first example query <xref href="#topic_find_v_examples/depend_table"
          format="dita"/> to find dependencies on user-defined functions (or procedures). The query
        uses the catalog table <codeph>pg_class</codeph> that contains information about tables and
        views. For functions, you can use the catalog table <xref
          href="../../ref_guide/system_catalogs/pg_proc.xml"><codeph>pg_proc</codeph></xref> to get
        information about functions. </p>
      <p>For detailed information about the system catalog tables that store view information, see
          <xref href="ddl-view-storage.xml"/>.</p>
      <section id="depend_table">
        <title>Finding Direct View Dependencies on a Table</title>
        <p>To find out which views directly depend on table <codeph>t1</codeph>, create a query that
          performs a join among the catalog tables that contain the dependency information, and
          qualify the query to return only view dependencies.</p>

        <p>The query performs casts to the <codeph>regclass</codeph> object identifier type. For
          information about object identifier types, see the PostgeSQL documentation on <xref
            href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/datatype-oid.html" format="html">Object
            Identifier Types</xref>.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the views are listed multiple times because the view references multiple
          table columns. You can remove those duplicates using <codeph>DISTINCT</codeph>.</p>
        <p>You can alter the query to find views with direct dependencies on the function
            <codeph>f</codeph>. <ul id="ul_m2y_mn2_jlb">
            <li>In the <codeph>SELECT</codeph> clause replace the name of the table
                <codeph>d.refobjid::regclass as ref_object</codeph> with the name of the function
                <codeph>d.refobjid::regproc as ref_object</codeph></li>
            <li>In the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause replace the catalog of the referenced object
              from <codeph>d.refclassid = 'pg_class'::regclass</codeph> for tables, to
                <codeph>d.refclassid = 'pg_proc'::regclass</codeph> for procedures (functions). Also
              change the object name from <codeph>d.refobjid = 't1'::regclass</codeph> to
                <codeph>d.refobjid = 'f'::regproc</codeph></li>
            <li>In the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause, replace the name of the table <codeph>refobjid

                'f'::regproc</codeph>.</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>In the example query, the changes have been commented out (prefixed with
            <codeph>--</codeph>). You can comment out the lines for the table and enable the lines
          for the function.</p>

        <p>You can modify the previous query to find those views that depend on a certain table
