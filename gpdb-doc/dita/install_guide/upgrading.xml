    <note type="important">Set the Greenplum Database timezone to a value that is compatible with
      your host systems. Setting the Greenplum Database timezone prevents Greenplum Database from
      selecting a timezone each time the cluster is restarted and sets the timezone for the
      Greenplum Database master and segment instances. After you upgrade to this release and if you
      have not set a Greenplum Database timezone value, verify that the selected Greenplum Database
      timezone is acceptable for your deployment. See <xref href="localization.xml" format="dita"

      <p>Before starting the upgrade process, perform the following checks. </p>
      <ul id="ul_ubx_szy_kbb">
        <li>Verify the health of the Greenplum Database host hardware, and verify that the hosts
          meet the requirements for running Greenplum Database. The Greenplum Database
            <codeph>gpcheckperf</codeph> utility can assist you in confirming the host requirements.
            <note>If you need to run the <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> utility, run it a few weeks
            before the upgrade during a maintenance period. If necessary, you can resolve any issues
            found by the utility before the scheduled upgrade.</note><p>The utility is in
              <codeph>$GPHOME/bin</codeph>. Place Greenplum Database in restricted mode when you run
            the <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> utility. See the <cite>Greenplum Database Utility
              Guide</cite> for information about the <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> utility.</p><p>If
              <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> reports catalog inconsistencies, you can run
              <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> with the <codeph>-g</codeph> option to generate SQL
            scripts to fix the inconsistencies.</p><p>After you run the SQL scripts, run
              <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> again. You might need to repeat the process of running
              <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> and creating SQL scripts to ensure that there are no
            inconsistencies. Run the SQL scripts generated by <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> on a
            quiescent system. The utility might report false alerts if there is activity on the
            system. </p><note type="important" otherprops="pivotal">If the
              <codeph>gpcheckcat</codeph> utility reports errors, but does not generate a SQL script

        <li>If you have configured the Greenplum Platform Extension Framework (PXF) in your previous

         PXF configuration files before upgrading to a new version of Greenplum Database. Refer to

        <li otherprops="pivotal">If you have configured and used the Greenplum Streaming Server (GPSS)
          in your previous Greenplum Database installation, you must stop any running GPSS jobs and
          service instances before you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database. Refer to

      <p>An upgrade from Greenplum Database <ph otherprops="0_or_x">6.x</ph> to a newer 6.x release
        involves stopping Greenplum Database, updating the Greenplum Database software binaries, and
